# Main benefits

**cx** has a very intuitive syntax and very similar to that of the [go programming language](https://golang.org/), which allows beginners to get into the software world to start, develop their first programs and get in touch of the world of computer science and it allows expert software developers can migrate to language, learn very quickly their syntax and special features, and start developing all kinds of systems, libraries, tools, frameworks, among other things.

This is a new language, it was created on July 15, 2017, by [Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net/) which means that it will have long-term support, besides that it has a large community behind that each day is growing more and more, and that will cause it to develop over time. Apart from being a general purpose language, the main objective of **cx** is to be able to integrate with technologies and tools created by [Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net/). Being a compiled and interpreted language, it offers the benefits of both and provides a large field of software development.

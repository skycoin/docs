# What cx can accomplish?

**Cx** being a high-level programming language compiled and interpreted, it can be used in a wide variety of branches of computer science, such as can be used to create programs that optimize processes or even create systems highly complex. Thanks to its easy and intuitive syntax, very similar to the go or python programming language, the learning curve is very short and allows developers and software engineers to focus on solving the main problem, without having to worry about the syntax.

The great speed offered by a **cx** program allows the development of complex systems such as:
 * Databases, relational and non-relational
 * HTTP, FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS servers and more.
 * [Multi-platform games](https://github.com/skycoin/cx-games)
 * Web, Desktop and Mobile frameworks
 * Command line software
 * Transpilators, Compilers and interpreted languages
 * Security tools
 * Blockchains
 * Emulators
 * Cryptocurrencies
 * Libraries
 * E-commerce
 * much more

But what makes **cx** stand out among hundreds and thousands of programming languages ​​created over time, is not its syntax or its great speed, are actually its main features, which are:

 * The Affordances, which represent a finite set of actions that can be performed on an element of the program, for example, the programmer can describe the environment where the module is compiled and run and the module will change its behavior according to those actions.
 * The serialization, which can be done even when the program is running in its interpreted or compiled form. A **cx** program can fully or partially serialize itself and send that serialized content over the internet into a remote computer and then resume its execution. 
 * Program stepping, which allows the software developer to control the execution of the program in a desired number of steps.
